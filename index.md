## About Me


I am a PhD student at<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank"> the University of Queensland</a>, supervised by A/Prof. <a href="https://baigd.github.io/" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Guangdong Bai</a> and Dr. <a href="https://people.csiro.au/x/j/jason-xue" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Jason Xue</a>. 
I am the recipient of the <a href="https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/"  style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Google PhD Fellowship</a>, and am currently serving as the HDR representative for the Cyber Security and Software Engineering discipline at UQ.
My research is generously supported by the RTP Scholarship and CSIRO's Data61 Top-up Scholarship.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on tackling real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems in a formally verifiable manner. I also work closely with my colleague <a href="https://zhongkuima.github.io/index.html" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Zhongkui Ma</a> on Neural Network Verification. Some of my recent projects include:
  - Neural Network Usage Control: <a href="https://www.zihan.com.au/assets/files/SP24CoreLocker.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">CoreLocker</a>@Oakland24
