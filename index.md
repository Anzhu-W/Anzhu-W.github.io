# About Me


I am a PhD student at the<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank"> University of Queensland</a>, working under the supervision of A/Prof. <a href="https://baigd.github.io/" target="_blank">Guangdong Bai</a> and Dr. <a href="https://people.csiro.au/x/j/jason-xue" target="_blank">Jason Xue</a>. 
I’m currently serving as the HDR representative for the CSS discipline.
My research is generously supported by the RTP Scholarship and CSIRO's Data61 Top-up Scholarship. I am also honored with the <a href="https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/" target="_blank">Google PhD Fellowship</a>, 2024.
