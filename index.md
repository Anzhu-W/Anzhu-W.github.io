# About Me


I am a second-year PhD student at the<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank"> University of Queensland</a>, working under the supervision of A/Prof. <a href="https://baigd.github.io/" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Guangdong Bai</a> and Dr. <a href="https://people.csiro.au/x/j/jason-xue" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Jason Xue</a>. 
I’m currently serving as the HDR representative for the Cyber Security and Software Engineering (CSS) discipline.

My research is generously supported by the RTP Scholarship and CSIRO's Data61 Top-up Scholarship, and I am a recipient of the <a href="https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/"  style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank"><u>Google PhD Fellowship 2024</u></a>.

<!-- ## Research Interests -->
My research interests are to tackle real-world security & privacy issues of machine learning systems in a formally verifiable manner. I also work closely with my colleague <a href="https://zhongkuima.github.io/index.html" style="color: #b8860b;" target="_blank">Zhongkui Ma</a> on Neural Network Verification. My works have been published in leading venues, including IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, USENIX Security, NeurIPS, WACV, and IEEE TCSS. Some of my recent projects include:
  - Neuron-level Usage Control: <a href="https://www.zihan.com.au/assets/files/SP24CoreLocker.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">CoreLocker</a>@Oakland'24
  - Privacy-preserving ML: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/0c79d6ed1788653643a1ac67b6ea32a7-Paper-Conference.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">Grab</a>@CCS'24, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/0c79d6ed1788653643a1ac67b6ea32a7-Paper-Conference.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">M⁴I</a>@NeurIPS'22
